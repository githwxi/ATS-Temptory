# Normalizing Lambda-Terms

# LambdaCal:

LambdaCal implements the so-called normalization-by-evaluations.
Essentially, this style of implementation circumvents the need for
performing term substitution.

# LambdaCal_rc:

LambdaCal_rc is a variant of LambdaCal, showcasing the support for
ref-counted datatypes in ATS/Temptory.

Happy programming in ATS-Temptory!!!
