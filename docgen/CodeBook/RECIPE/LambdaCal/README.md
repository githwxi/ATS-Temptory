# Normalizing Lambda-Terms

# LambdaCal:

LambdaCal implements the so-called normalization-by-evaluation.
Essentially, this style of implementation circumvents the need for
performing term substitution by building closures.

# LambdaCal_rc:

LambdaCal_rc is a memory-clean variant of LambdaCal, showcasing the
support for ref-counted datatypes in ATS/Temptory.

Happy programming in ATS-Temptory!!!
