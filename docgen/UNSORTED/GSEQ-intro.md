# Verbs for Batch-Processing

When teaching functional programming, I often get a question like**:
How can one access an element in a list when given the index of the
element? It is mostly likely that the person who asks this question
is still of a mentality that focuses on what I call individual-processing
(instead of batch-processing). 

In functional programming, batch-processing is commonly associated with
the use of combinators (which are often higher-order functions of relatively
small bodies). Temptory strongly advocates batch-processing. And it does so
by making extensive use of templates.

  
## Commonly used Verbs

I list as follows some commonly used verbs and their variations in
the context of batch-processing elements sequentially. Note that an
implementation of a verb for a particular datatype is often referred
to as a combinator.

------

* **listize**:
  It is for turning a given sequence into a linear list
* **rlistize**:
  It is for turning a given sequence into a linear list
  in the reverse order
* **streamize**:
  It is for turning a given sequence into a linear stream
  
* **forall**:
  It is for processing a given sequence
  until the processing function returns false.
* **exists**:
  It is for processing a given sequence
  until the processing function returns true.

* **foreach**:
  It is for processing a given sequence in its entirety.
  
* **foldleft**:
  It is for processing a given sequence in its entirety and returning
  the accumulated result at the end
  
* **map_list**: It is for applying a given function to each element in a
  given sequence and returning a linear list consisting of the results
  of these applications in the order as they are produced.
  
* **map_rlist**: It is for applying a given function to each element in a
  given sequence and returning a linear list consisting of the results
  of these applications in the reverse order as they are produced.

* **map_stream**:
  It is for lazily applying a given function to each element in a given
  sequence and returning a linear stream consisting of the results of
  these applications in the order as they are produced.

------

* **rexists**:
  It is like `exists` but processing in done in the reverse order
* **rforall**:
  It is like `forall` but processing in done in the reverse order
* **rforeach**:
  It is like `foreach` but processing in done in the reverse order
* **foldright**:
  It is like `foldleft` but processing in done in the reverse order

* **rmap_list**:
  It is like `map_list` but processing in done in the reverse order
* **rmap_rlist**:
  It is like `map_rlist` but processing in done in the reverse order

------

Given a sequence, the i-version of the sequence consists of pairs
where each pair is the index of an element coupled with the element
itself. For instance, the i-version of the list `(a, b, c)` is simply
`((0, a), (1, b), (2, c))`.

Given a verb, the i-version of the verb is often named `i{verb}`,
where `{verb}` refers to the name of the verb.  Basically, applying
the i-version of a verb to a given sequence is like applying the verb
to the i-version of the sequence.

* **iexists**: It is the i-version of `exists`
* **iforall**: It is the i-version of `forall`
* **iforeach**: It is the i-version of `foreach`
* **ifoldleft**: It is the i-version of `foldleft`

* **imap_list**: It is the i-version of `map_list`.
* **imap_rlist**: It is the i-version of `map_rlist`.
* **imap_stream**: It is the i-version of `map_stream`.

------

Given two sequences `xs` and `ys`, let `zip(xs, ys)` be the result of
zipping `xs` and `ys`. Given a verb, the z-version of the verb is
often named `z{verb}` where `{verb}` refers to the name of the
verb. Basically, applying the z-version of a verb to two given
sequences `xs` and `ys` is like applying the verb to `zip(xs, ys)`.
  
* **zforall**: It is the z-version of `forall`.  
* **zforeach**: It is the z-version of `foreach`.
* **zfoldleft**: It is the z-version of `foldleft`.

* **zmap_list**: It is the z-version of `map_list`.
* **zmap_rlist**: It is the z-version of `map_rlist`.
* **zmap_stream**: It is the z-version of `map_stream`.

------

Given two sequences `xs` and `ys`, let `cross(xs, ys)` be the result
of crossing `xs` by `ys`. Given a verb, the x-version of the verb is
often named `x{verb}` where `{verb}` refers to the name of the
verb. Basically, applying the z-version of a verb to two given
sequences `xs` and `ys` is like applying the verb to `cross(xs, ys)`.

* **xforall**: It is the x-version of `forall`.    
* **xforeach**: It is the x-version of `foreach`.
* **xfoldleft**: It is the x-version of `foldleft`.

* **xmap_list**: It is the x-version of `map_list`.
* **xmap_rlist**: It is the x-version of `map_rlist`.
* **xmap_stream**: It is the x-version of `map_stream`.

------

I will be introducing more verbs elsewhere. My own experience
indicates that the above list of verbs are already adequate for
average programming needs.

## Verb Dependencies in the GSEQ package

Given two verbs `verb1` and `verb2`, I write `verb1 < verb2` to mean
that there is an implementation of `verb2` that depends on `verb1`. In
other words, `verb2` is available for use as long as `verb1` is
implemented. In the terms of OOP, one may see `verb2` as a method
whose implementation calls anther method `verb1`.  If `verb2` depends
on `verb1`, I may also say `verb1` supports `verb2`.

In the GSEQ package, the following verb dependecies exist:

* streamize < forall

* forall < exists
* forall < foreach 
* foreach < foldleft
* foldleft < listize

* rlistize < rforall
* foldleft < rlistize  

* foldleft < map_list
* foldleft < map_rlist
* streamize < map_stream

* foldleft < imap_list
* foldleft < imap_rlist
* streamize < imap_stream

* forall < iforall
* iforall < iexists
* iforall < iforeach
* iforeach < ifoldleft

* rforall < rexists
* rforall < rforeach
* rforeach < foldright

There is really no need to memorize these verb dependencies at this
point.  All one really should be clear about for now is that if
`streamize` is implemented, then all of the other verbs are available
for use. And please note that all of the verbs are given tail-recursive
implementations in the GSEQ package.

## Let's see some verbs in action!

The famous 8-queen puzzle asks the player to find ways to put eight
queen pieces on a chess board such that no queen piece can attack any
other ones. In other words, no two queen pieces can be put on the same
row, the same column, or the same diagnal.

Let us first declare an abstract type `board` for values representing
board configurations and then implement it as a list:

```ats
(* ****** ****** *)

abstbox board = ptr

(* ****** ****** *)

extern
fun
board_nil(): board
and
board_cons(int, board): board

(* ****** ****** *)

local

absimpl board = list0(int)

in(* in-of-local *)

implement
board_nil() = nil()
implement
board_cons(x0, xs) = cons(x0, xs)

implement
gseq_streamize<board><int>(xs) = list0_streamize<int>(xs)

end (* end of [local] *)

```

Note that the verb `streamize` is implemented for `board`, which
immidiately makes all of the other verbs listed above available for
use.

For instance, the following function `board_check` can be called to
check if putting a queen piece at column `x0` on the next row can
cause a conflict with the queen pieces on the current board `xs`:

```ats
fun
board_check
(x0: int, xs: board): bool =
(
gseq_iforall<board><int>(xs)
) where
{
implement
gseq_iforall$test<int>(i1, x1) =
if (x0 != x1) then (abs(x0 - x1) != i1 + 1) else false
}
```

Note that `abs` stands for the absolute value function.
The next function `board_print` is for printing out a given board:


```ats
fun
board_print
(xs: board): void =
(
gseq_rforeach<board><int>
  (xs)
) where
{
implement
gseq_rforeach$work<int>(x0) =
(
  loop(0)
) where
{
fun
loop(i0: int): void =
if
i0 >= N
then
println!((*void*))
else
(
if i0 = x0 then print "Q " else print ". "; loop(i0+1)
)
}
} (* end of [board_print *)
```

Note that the verb `rforeach` is used because the list representation
of a board actually represents the board in the reverse order: the
first element in the list represents the column position of the last
queen piece and the last element in the list represents the column
position of the first queen piece. For instance, Solution#1 is printed
out as follows:


```
Solution#1:
Q . . . . . . . 
. . . . Q . . . 
. . . . . . . Q 
. . . . . Q . . 
. . Q . . . . . 
. . . . . . Q . 
. Q . . . . . . 
. . . Q . . . . 
```
