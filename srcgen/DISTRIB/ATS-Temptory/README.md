# ATS-Temptory
For supporting template-based programming

## Build Status

* [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/githwxi/ATS-Temptory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/githwxi/ATS-Temptory) Ubuntu

## Project Description

ATS-Temptory can be seen as a repackaging of ATS-Postiats.
  
Compared with ATS-Postiats, the core library of ATS-Temptory is
completely re-written from scratch so as to better facilitate the use
of templates in support of code sharing and reuse. It can be seen
clearly that the style of template-based programming as is supported
in ATS-Temptory is of a disruptive nature. One might even compare this
programming style to OOP at its early stage.

At this point, I am taking a break from implementing ATS-Xanadu.  I
plan to concentrate on developing ATS-Temptory. In particular, I would
like to use ATS-Temptory as a vehicle to demonstrate some of the
powers of template-based programming in helping greatly increase
programming productivity.
